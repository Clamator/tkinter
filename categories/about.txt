this program is made to count you incomes and money wasting.
you can use keyboard number keys to input digit and do refill or withdraw
to refill - click 'r'
to withdraw - click 'w'
to clear an entry window - click 'c'
avoid to click on entry window, in that case you should click Tab once (this bug is in correction process)

also i'm going to add month zeroing on money waste, wasting history, category addind and other things
